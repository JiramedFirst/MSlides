-- osascript render.applescript <deck.pptx> <out> [pdf]
-- Keynote is the macOS renderer (no LibreOffice there); it reads .pptx directly.
-- `open` does NOT reliably return the document for an imported .pptx (it once returned an "unmerge id" object,
-- and `export` sent to that object crashed Keynote). So: open, wait until a document with OUR file's
-- name exists that was not open before, and address that one. Never touch other open documents — the user may
-- have unsaved work in them.
